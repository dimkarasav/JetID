A) Instructions to produce "big" ntuples from public datasets 


https://github.com/dimkarasav/JetID/blob/main/New_producer/README_big_ntuples_on_crab


====================================================================================================================================

B) Create reduced ntuples for JetHT / QCD samples


cd CMSDIJET/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer

Instructions to produce reduced ntuples can be found at bash_scripts/README_reduced_trees_condor.txt.

https://github.com/dimkarasav/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer/blob/JetID/bash_scripts/README_reduced_trees_condor.txt

Before moving to the analysis scripts, there should be one reduced .root file per JetHT/QCD sample. (eg. One .root file  per running period for data, one .root file per QCD pT-hat binned sample, etc.)

====================================================================================================================================

C) JetID analysis scripts for JetHT/ QCD samples 

All .C scripts have their inputs / outputs hardcoded (but in a clean way that is easy to find by editing the files). 

To run the scripts, edit them to define the input files, output directories, options, etc and run them as the example below: 

root -l
.L C_scripts/btbdijets_eff_Tag_and_Probe_recalcJetID.C++
btbdijets_eff_Tag_and_Probe_recalcJetID()
.q

i) C_scripts/btbdijets_eff_Tag_and_Probe_recalcJetID.C

====================================================================================================================================
D) Process Minimum Bias datasets.


Go to the JetID/New_producer directory (before the CMSSW release). 

This repository is independent of the CMSSW versions. It was created to process the MinBias big ntuples so that we can save more than the two leading jets per event and apply custom JetID criteria on the fly.

For future development it is possible to make the whole JetID analysis this way so that you only need a CMSSW release to produce the big ntuples. For now it is only used for the MinBias samples.


To produce reduced ntuples use the shell scripts at New_producer/bash_scripts/ and follow thw instructions for condor jobs as was on step B:

https://github.com/dimkarasav/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer/blob/JetID/bash_scripts/README_reduced_trees_condor.txt

The only difference is that you do not need to specify any CMSSW related parameters.


E) JetID analysis scripts for MinBias samples

i) C_scripts/Make_MinBias_Histos.C

	Description: 

			Creates .root file with histograms of jet characteristics with and without applying JetID.

	Input: 

					reduced MinBias ntuples from step D.

	Output: .root file with histograms of jet characteristics with and without applying JetID

ii) C_scripts/Plot_bkg_rejection.C

	Description: 

			Makes plots of JetID background rejection as a function of pT for various |η| bins.

	Input: 
		.root of step (i)

	Output: plot of JetID background rejection as a function of pT for various |η| bins.

iii) C_scripts/Calculate_bkg_rejection.C

	Description: 
		Prints on terminal the absolute bkg-rejection for each |η| bin.

	Input: 
		.root of step (i)

	Output: No outputs. Just prints on terminal.

Note: There are more scripts in the "C_scripts/" like "Make_JetHT_btb_Histos.C" which are not currently needed for the JetID analysis as used here. 
They were part of the "future development" that can be done in order to run the whole JetID analysis independently of a CMSSW release and with more freedom with respect to the data format of the reduced ntuple files.
